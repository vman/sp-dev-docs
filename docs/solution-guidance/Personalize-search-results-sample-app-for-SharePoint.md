# Personalize search results sample add-in for SharePoint

You can personalize SharePoint by filtering information that is shown to the user based on the value of a user profile property.
    
_**Applies to:** Office 365 | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint Online_
    
The [Search.PersonalizedResults](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Search.PersonalizedResults) code sample shows how you can personalize SharePoint by filtering information based on the value of a user profile property. Some examples of pesonalization include:

- News articles or other content filtered by country or location.
    
- Navigation links filtered based on the user's role or organization.
    
- Restaurants or retail outlet listings based on the location of your place of business.
    
This code sample uses a provider-hosted add-in to display search results to the user that include either all sites or only team sites that the user has access to. To do this, the sample:

- Checks the value of the  **AboutMe** user profile property.
    
- Builds a search query filter string associated with the value of the  **AboutMe** user profile property.
    
- Runs the search query and displays the search query results.

## Before you begin
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

To get started, download the  [Search.PersonalizedResults](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Search.PersonalizedResults) sample add-in from the [Office 365 Developer patterns and practices](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP/tree/dev) project on GitHub.

## Using the Search.PersonalizedResults app
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When you run this code sample, a provider-hosted application appears, as shown in Figure 1. 

**Figure 1. Start page of the Search.PersonalizedResults app**

This article describes the  **Perform personalized search of all site templates using profile data** scenario. Choosing **Perform Personalized Search** returns filtered search results that contain team sites only, as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the **Template** column contains sites of type **STS** only.

**Figure 2. Search results showing team sites only**

For handling personalization scenarios, you can change the search query by:

- Reading and testing the value of a user profile property for that user. This code sample tests the  **About Me** property for a value of **AppTest**.
    
- Taking a specific course of action based on the value of the user profile property. For example, if the value of the  **About Me** user profile property is **AppTest**, this code sample removes the team site filter and returns search results that contain all sites.

### To enter AppTest in the About Me user profile property

1. At the top of your Office 365 site, choose your profile picture, then choose  **About Me**, as shown in Figure 3.
    
2. On the  **About me** page, choose **edit your profile**.
    
3. In  **About me**, enter  **AppTest**.
    
4. Choose  **Save all and close**.

![Screenshot of the user profile page with About me highlighted.](media/a7eccfcd-68f7-44b9-8f32-14a0d2f60398.png)

Return to the  **Search.PersonalizedResults** provider-hosted add-in and choose **Perform Personalized Search** again. The add-in changes the filter on the search query to show all sites instead of team sites only, as shown in Figure 4. The **Template** column now contains several different site template types.

Choosing  **Perform Personalized Search** calls the **btnPersonalizedSearch_Click** method in default.aspx.cs. **btnPersonalizedSearch_Click** performs the following actions:

- Uses  **PeopleManager** to get all user profile properties for the user running this add-in.
    
- Retrieves and checks the value of the  **AboutMe** user profile property. If the value of the **AboutMe** property is **AppTest**, the search query retrieves all sites using the query string  `contentclass:"STS_Site"`. If the value of the  **AboutMe** property is not **AppTest**, the team site filter is appended to the query string ( `WebTemplate=STS`), and the search query retrieves team sites only.
    
- Calls the  **ProcessQuery** method to retrieve the search results based on the supplied query string. **ProcessQuery** also demonstrates how to specify a list of properties to return with the search results.
    
- Calls the  **FormatResults** method to format the search results into an HTML table.

            keywordQuery.SortList.Add("SPSiteUrl", Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Search.Query.SortDirection.Ascending);
            SearchExecutor searchExec = new SearchExecutor(ctx);
            ClientResult<ResultTableCollection> results = searchExec.ExecuteQuery(keywordQuery);
            ctx.ExecuteQuery();
            return results;
        }
